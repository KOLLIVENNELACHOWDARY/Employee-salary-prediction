# Employee-salary-prediction

This machine learning project predicts whether a person's income is **above or below 50K/month**, using demographic and work-related data. The model is trained on the **Adult Income dataset** (UCI Machine Learning Repository).

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

To develop a supervised machine learning model that predicts whether an individual earns more than \$50K annually based on various features such as education, occupation, hours worked per week, etc.

## 🧪 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Selection & Training**
5. **Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)**
6. **Model Saving using Pickle**
7. **Deployment (optional: Streamlit/Flask)**
